/// The local passthrough must contain its child in a job object, exactly as the relayed path
/// does, so that failing open can never become a way to outlive the session.
///
/// This used to be the property that made a MISCLASSIFIED command harmless: while the shim routed
/// suspected transfers around the relay, a string the client chose decided a security outcome, and
/// naming any binary `scp.exe` was enough to be spawned outside the job object and survive session
/// teardown. That classifier is gone and every command relays now, which makes this test matter
/// more rather than less — fail-open is the ONLY local spawn left, so this containment is the sole
/// thing between an unreachable agent and a process that outlives the session the README promises
/// to reap.
///
/// `cosca::Job` sets `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so dropping the job must terminate the child. Before
/// containment was added the child was created with `PROCESS_CREATION_FLAGS(0)` and no job at
/// all, and would simply keep running here — which is exactly what this test would catch.
